# IMDB_rating_NLP
Predicted the IMDB rating by using the imdb_reviews from tensorflow_datasets tfds dataset. 

I have used following method for creating model for prediction: 
1. Model with Embedding layer 
2. Model with LSTM layer  

I have visualised the word embedding by using the Tensorflow projector. 
Please use following steps to visualize the embedding on the projector:  
1. Download above 2 files and upload it into https://projector.tensorflow.org/ 
2. Try to visualize it in the above website   

I have also tried to import a transformer model tried to verify the outcome based on the input i gave.
